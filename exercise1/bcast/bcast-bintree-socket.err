This test requires at least two processes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Primary job  terminated normally, but 1 process returned
a non-zero exit code. Per user-direction, the job has been aborted.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
mpirun detected that one or more processes exited with non-zero status, thus causing
the job to be terminated. The first process to do so was:

  Process name: [[25746,1],0]
  Exit code:    1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
slurmstepd: error: *** JOB 344073 ON epyc003 CANCELLED AT 2024-02-06T01:40:12 DUE TO TIME LIMIT ***
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
ORTE has lost communication with a remote daemon.

  HNP daemon   : [[35700,0],0] on node epyc003
  Remote daemon: [[35700,0],1] on node epyc004

This is usually due to either a failure of the TCP network
connection to the node, or possibly an internal failure of
the daemon itself. We cannot recover from this failure, and
therefore will terminate the job.
