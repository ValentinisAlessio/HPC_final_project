slurmstepd: error: *** JOB 343684 ON epyc006 CANCELLED AT 2024-02-05T13:31:10 DUE TO TIME LIMIT ***
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
ORTE has lost communication with a remote daemon.

  HNP daemon   : [[46772,0],0] on node epyc006
  Remote daemon: [[46772,0],1] on node epyc007

This is usually due to either a failure of the TCP network
connection to the node, or possibly an internal failure of
the daemon itself. We cannot recover from this failure, and
therefore will terminate the job.
