slurmstepd: error: *** JOB 343687 ON epyc004 CANCELLED AT 2024-02-05T14:18:40 DUE TO TIME LIMIT ***
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
ORTE has lost communication with a remote daemon.

  HNP daemon   : [[48851,0],0] on node epyc004
  Remote daemon: [[48851,0],1] on node epyc005

This is usually due to either a failure of the TCP network
connection to the node, or possibly an internal failure of
the daemon itself. We cannot recover from this failure, and
therefore will terminate the job.
