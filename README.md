This repository contains all the scripts and materials used and collected for the High Performance Computing exam assignment. All the complete assignemt texts are available in the main course [repository](https://github.com/Foundations-of-HPC/High-Performance-Computing-2023/tree/main/ASSIGNMENTS)

- `Exercise 1`: study and benchmark, using the OSU-microbenchmark library, the latency of the `MPI_Bcast` and of another collective operation of the MPI library, and try to develop a model.

- `Exercise 2`: implement, using an hybrid approach between `MPI` and `OpenMP`, a parallel quicksort algorithm, and study its performance and scalability.
